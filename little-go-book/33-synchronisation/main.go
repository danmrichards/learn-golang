// The only concurrent thing you can safely do to a variable is to read from it.
// You can have as many readers as you want, but writes need to be synchronized.
// There are various ways to do this, including using some truly atomic
// operations that rely on special CPU instructions. However, the most common
// approach is to use a mutex.

// While it might be tempting to use coarse locks (locks that cover a large
// amount of code), that undermines the very reason weâ€™re doing concurrent
// programming in the first place. We generally want fine locks; else, we end up
// with a ten-lane highway that suddenly turns into a one-lane road.

// A mutex serializes access to the code under lock. The reason we simply define
